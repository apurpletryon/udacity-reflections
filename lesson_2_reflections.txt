What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Files and metadata about the repository are created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area contains the files you're ready to commit. The staging directory contains all files associated with your project. To preserve logical consistency of commits, you might not want to commit all files in the working directory at the same time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Work on and test your changes in the working directory. Only add them to the staging area when you're ready to commit, then immediately commit them.

\What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches are useful to keep track of different versions of a program, such as different languages, features, etc, each of which you may want to present to a different set of end users.
